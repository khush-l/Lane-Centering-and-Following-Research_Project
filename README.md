# Lane Centering and Following

## Overview

This repository contains work from the NSF Autonomous Robots and Cars Research and Mentorship Program at the University of Texas at Austin, under the guidance of Professor Junmin Wang. The project focuses on developing and implementing real-time lane detection and lane-following algorithms using the Quanser QCar platform.

## Goal

The goal of this project was to create algorithms that enable autonomous vehicles to detect and follow lane lines accurately in real-time. By processing camera inputs, the system provides precise steering commands to ensure the vehicle remains centered along its lane.

## Methods

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Images from the QCar's cameras are resized, transformed to a birdâ€™s-eye view, and converted to binary format to highlight lane lines.

3. **Lane Detection**: Utilized DBSCAN clustering to identify lane lines from the processed images.

4. **Lane Following**: Applied the Pure Pursuit algorithm to calculate steering angles and a PID controller to manage speed.

## Results

The lane-following system demonstrated effective real-time lane detection and accurate lane centering in multiple test scenarios. The speed remained constant at the goal of .5 m/s and the steering was smooth.
